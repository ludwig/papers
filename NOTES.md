# Notes
Figure out a way to keep related documents together. Create a graph of references?
Would it be possible to automatically analyze the text and automatically create
those clusters? Or do I have to input them manually.

Also, let's find a way to search for BibTeX information via APIs.
Should be easier for arxiv papers, or papers that already have a DOI.
